# Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Warre Bossaert, a 18 years old software developer.

## About me

I'm passionate about two main things: hitting the gym and programming. Whether I'm lifting weights or diving into lines of code, I find joy and fulfillment in pushing myself to improve. I'm an active member of CodeFever, where I share my passion and knowledge with the young learners.

For me, life is all about continuous growth and self-improvement. Every day, I strive to be better than I was yesterday, both physically and mentally. Through my dedication to fitness and coding, I'm building a foundation for a brighter future, one where I can make a positive impact and inspire others to do the same.

While I may not have had any particularly extraordinary experiences to share yet, I'm excited about the journey ahead and the opportunities that await. My interests in the gym and programming shape my perspective on life, reminding me that progress is a journey, not a destination.

As for my future, I see it filled with endless possibilities and opportunities for growth. I'm eager to continue learning, evolving, and spreading positivity wherever I go. Together, let's embrace the power of self-improvement and create a better tomorrow, one rep and one line of code at a time.

## Projects

Throughout my learning journey, I worked on multiple projects that have challenged me to apply and expand my skills. Some of these projects have seen the light of day, while others... well, let's just say they're still waiting for their moment of glory. But hey, even the projects that never quite made it to the finish line taught me valuable lessons.

### Ongoing project: MenuCard Digitalization

I'm currently developing a platform for businesses to create and customize their online menu cards, easily shareable through websites or QR codes. 

### Project archive

- RoShop: a marketplace designed specifically for game developers to buy and sell development assets. 
- Speakr: Speakr is a social media web application developed as my final project in secondary school. It offers features such as post sharing, chat functionality, and advertisements.
